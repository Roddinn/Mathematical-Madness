# Mathematical-Madness
In this game, you will be given random simple math problems. You must press the button of the correct answer to pass the question. There will be a timer, starting from 10 seconds, that will progressively get smaller every 10 problems answered, capping at 3 seconds! You only have 1 try to get a high score!
